## Introduction

When using [Hashicorp's Vault][vault] you may want to have an authentication token which only has permissions to seal the vault. This can then be used in an emergency situation to seal the vault, [perhaps through a chatbot][opsdroid-skill-vault].

### The policy

The seal only policy is fairly simple. Just create a `.hcl` policy file with the following contents:

```
path "/sys/seal" {
  policy = "sudo"
}
```

### Create the policy

Create a new policy in vault using the policy file you just created.

```
vault policy-write seal-only /path/to/my/policy.hcl
```

### Generate a token

You can now generate tokens which only have the seal permission. You must do this with a root key or a user with `sudo` permissions on `auth/token/create`.

```
vault token-create -orphan -policy="seal-only"
```

This will print out a new token with seal only permissions.

```
Key            	Value
---            	-----
token          	abcdefgh-1234-5678-abcd-zyxwvutrspqo
token_accessor 	abcdefgh-1234-5678-abcd-zyxwvutrspqo
token_duration 	168h0m0s
token_renewable	true
token_policies 	[default seal-only]
```

### Renewing

As you can see this token will expire after 7 days. If this token is being used by a bot or similar system you probably want to implement some scheduled process to [renew the token's lease][vault-renew-token].
