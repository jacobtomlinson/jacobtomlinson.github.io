For the last month I've been getting used to working remotely. I've worked on many open source projects in the past with collaborators around the world, but this is the first time that I've been 100% remote from the people I'm working with. So far it's been going great, but it really has shown me the importance of a good profile picture.

Currently my primary means of working with my colleagues is either via email (Outlook), Slack or GitHub. In all of these applications every message that is sent and received is accompanied with a picture of the person you're speaking to. It's notoriously difficult to convey emotion and emphasis in a text only communication method and it has really become clear to me that some social queues that are normally communicated in body language are picked up subconsciously from the profile picture. Everything that a person says is going to be read in the context of their profile picture. If your picture is friendly and welcoming then everything you say will be taken with a positive spin, if it is cold and professional then your words could feel more critical. I wanted to break down what I think are some good guidelines for creating your profile picture in order to make communication easier and new starters feel welcome.
